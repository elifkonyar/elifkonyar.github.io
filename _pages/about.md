I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student, supervised by [Dr. Mostafa Reisi Gahrooei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GRoULwcAAAAJ&hl=en), in Industrial & Systems Engineering at University of Florida.

My primary research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and statistics to model and monitor systems with high-dimensional and heterogeneous data. Particularly, I am interested in tensor-based modeling and federated learning approaches for high-dimensional data settings.

Before starting my Ph.D., I have mainly worked on wind power prediction problem under the supervision of [Dr. Mustafa Gokce Baydogan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=M7cmlmcAAAAJ&hl=en) at Bogazici University in Istanbul, Turkey.
