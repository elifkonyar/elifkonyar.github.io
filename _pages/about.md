I am a Carmine and Jean Iannacone Postdoctoral Fellow under [Dr. Kamran Paynabar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CwMCid0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) in the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE) at Georgia Institute of Technology. I completed my Ph.D. under the supervision of [Dr. Mostafa Reisi Gahrooei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GRoULwcAAAAJ&hl=en) in Industrial & Systems Engineering at the University of Florida. 

My primary research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and statistics, with a focus on modeling and monitoring complex systems characterized by high-dimensional and heterogeneous data. Specifically, I am interested in developing tensor-based modeling techniques and federated learning frameworks tailored for high-dimensional and multimodal data. These approaches have various applications in healthcare, agriculture and energy systems. In addition, I am interested in adaptive sampling and reinforcement learning methods for multi-source sensor systems to extract actionable knowledge to facilitate robust and informed decision-making.

I am always eager to explore collaborative opportunities that advance these areas of research and welcome interdisciplinary projects that can create impactful solutions. Please [contact me](mailto:ekonyar3@gatech.edu) if you are interested in collaborating!

Outside of work, I enjoy biking, running and hiking, and I am a big coffee enthusiast.
