I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student, supervised by [Dr. Mostafa Reisi Gahrooei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GRoULwcAAAAJ&hl=en), in Industrial & Systems Engineering at University of Florida. I will be joining to ISyE at Georgia Institute of Technology as a Carmine and Jean Iannacone Postdoctoral Fellow in January 2025.

My primary research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and statistics to model and monitor systems with high-dimensional and heterogeneous data. Particularly, I am interested in tensor-based modeling and federated learning approaches for high-dimensional and multimodal data settings with applications in healthcare and agriculture.

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I have worked on wind power prediction problem under the supervision of [Dr. Mustafa Gokce Baydogan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=M7cmlmcAAAAJ&hl=en) at Bogazici University in Istanbul, Turkey.
