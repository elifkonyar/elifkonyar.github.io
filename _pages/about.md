I am a Carmine and Jean Iannacone Postdoctoral Fellow in the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE) at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am fortunate to complete my Ph.D. under the supervision of [Dr. Mostafa Reisi Gahrooei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GRoULwcAAAAJ&hl=en) in Industrial & Systems Engineering at the University of Florida. 

My primary research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and statistics, with a focus on modeling and monitoring complex systems characterized by high-dimensional and heterogeneous data. Specifically, I am interested in developing tensor-based modeling techniques and federated learning frameworks tailored for high-dimensional and multimodal data. These approaches have various applications in healthcare, agriculture and energy systems. In addition, I am interested in adaptive sampling and reinforcement learning methods for multi-source sensor systems to extract actionable knowledge to facilitate robust and informed decision-making.

I am always eager to explore collaborative opportunities that advance these areas of research and welcome interdisciplinary projects that can create impactful solutions. Please feel free to reach out if you are interested in collaborating!
