I am a Carmine and Jean Iannacone Postdoctoral Fellow working with [Dr. Kamran Paynabar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CwMCid0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) in the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE) at Georgia Institute of Technology. I earned my Ph.D. in Industrial & Systems Engineering at the University of Florida under the supervision of [Dr. Mostafa Reisi Gahrooei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GRoULwcAAAAJ&hl=en). 

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, data science, and data-driven decision-making, with a focus on developing interpretable, robust, and privacy-preserving methods for analyzing high-dimensional and multimodal data. A central theme of my work is transforming diverse and irregular data streams into trustworthy insights that support organizational and societal decision-making. I develop tensor-based and federated frameworks for personalized and privacy-preserving modeling, as well as multimodal data fusion techniques for human-centered AI systems. More broadly, I aim to design human-centered and trustworthy analytics that bridge methodological rigor with real-world impact across healthcare, transportation, energy, and immersive technologies.  

Key areas of my research include:  
- **Multimodal Data Fusion for Human-Centered AI and AR/VR Systems** – integrating gaze, head, hand, and physiological signals to model expertise, workload, and behavioral dynamics.  
- **Computational Phenotyping and Risk Prediction from EHR** – tensor-based models for interpretable patient phenotypes and outcome prediction from irregular and partially labeled data.  
- **Privacy-Preserving and Federated Analytics for Healthcare and Complex Systems** – frameworks enabling cross-institutional collaboration without sharing raw data, with applications in healthcare, agriculture, and manufacturing.  
- **Personalized Modeling in Telemonitoring and Neuroimaging** – multi-task tensor learning for individualized predictions in Parkinson’s severity monitoring and ADHD characterization.  
- **Forecasting and Decision Support in Energy and Transportation** – adaptive methods for renewable energy forecasting and resilience-focused monitoring of transportation networks.  

I am always open to collaborative opportunities that push these areas forward and welcome interdisciplinary projects with societal impact. Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:ekonyar3@gatech.edu) if you are interested in working together.

Outside of work, I enjoy biking, running and hiking, and I am a big coffee enthusiast.
